# duration of 2000 ~= 1 second

# skip-duration means we will spend at most this much time on the channel before moving on.
# setting it to -1 disables this; meaning that we'll stay on this frequency as long as it consistently has
# a signal on it.

# wait-duration means after a signal disapears, we will wait that much more time for it to come back;
# and if it does come back, the wait timer will be reset.
